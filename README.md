## About

The Particle Simulator models the movement and interaction of particles in a controlled environment, simulating physical forces like gravity, electrostatic forces, and collision dynamics. It provides a visual representation of how particles interact with each other based on their properties such as mass, charge, and velocity.

The simulation can be used for educational purposes to understand basic physics principles or as a foundation for more complex simulations.

## Features

- **Real-Time Visualization**: Displays the movement and interaction of particles in a graphical interface.
- **Customizable Particle Properties**: Allows users to adjust properties like mass, charge, velocity, and size for each particle.
- **Force Simulation**: Models forces such as gravity, electrostatic attraction, and collision responses between particles.
- **Adjustable Parameters**: Provides an interface to modify environmental factors like friction, particle density, and the number of particles.
